# grubach

> To K., Frau Grubach, his landlady, is a simple, naïve woman who trusts him implicitly. He's so confident in her trust in him > that he believes that, if he tells her that he assaulted Fraülein Bürstner, she would not only believe him, but also 
> continue to trust him. But this simple woman does seem to have a better grasp of K.'s trial then he does when she muses that > his crime seems to be a "scholarly" matter, not a more common crime like theft. Unlike K., she immediately grasps that K.'s > trial will defy ordinary, common-sense notions of law and order, even if she can't articulate exactly how unique K.'s trial > will be.
